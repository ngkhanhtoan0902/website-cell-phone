                <h2>What Are Cookies</h2>
                <p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites, WriterZen uses cookies, which are tiny files

                    they gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you
                    can prevent these cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of
                    the site's functionality.</p>
